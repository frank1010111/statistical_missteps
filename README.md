Here we show, through Monte Carlo experiments, three examples of statistical
missteps that we have seen in the reservoir characterization literature.

The mistakes are

1. Applying algebra to linear least squares regression models
2. Improperly de-transforming a log-transformed variable in a linear least
   square model without accounting for bias
3. Mis-applying R<sup>2<sup>

All of the examples are in `Statistics pitfalls.ipynb`. Exposition around the
first misstep is available in the notebook
`Applying algebra to regression.ipynb`; the second is discussed in
`Regression on transformed variables.ipynb`. The third misstep is detailed in
`Misinterpreting R-squared.ipynb`.
